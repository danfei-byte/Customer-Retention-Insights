# T-Mobile Customer Retention Analysis
### From Acquisition to Loyalty: Data Insights for Sustainable Growth
## Project Overview
This project investigates key drivers of customer retention at T-Mobile, focusing on customers’ reasons for joining the service and the influence of word-of-mouth (WOM) sentiment. Using regression modeling, the study identifies actionable strategies to improve loyalty, reduce churn, and strengthen T-Mobile’s customer base over time.

## Objectives
- Understand how initial motivations (reasons for joining) impact long-term retention.
- Quantify the effect of positive vs. negative WOM sentiment on churn likelihood.
- Control for demographic and service-related factors (e.g., age, tenure, cost) to isolate the strongest predictors of retention.

## Key Findings
- Customers who joined for Reason 3 are ~2.94% more likely to stay; those who joined for Reason 8 are ~5.75% more likely to churn.
- Negative WOM sentiment has the strongest impact: "All Negative" → 61.4% decrease in retention likelihood, "Mostly Negative" → 41.1% decrease, "All Positive" → 8.2% increase
- Demographics such as older age groups showed higher retention; higher subscription cost and frequent service contact slightly reduced retention.

## Recommendations
1. Attract high-retention customers (Reason 3) using success-story-driven campaigns.
2. Reframe marketing for low-retention customers (Reason 8) to set realistic expectations.
3. Build a brand advocacy community to amplify positive WOM.
4. Leverage user-generated content to boost authenticity and trust.
5. Address negative feedback proactively, especially in high-risk customer clusters.

## Tools Used
- R for statistical modeling
- Excel for initial data review
- Linear regression for identifying retention drivers
